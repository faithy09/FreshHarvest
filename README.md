# Project Title - Analysis of Defective Batches in Food Processing

# Data Source- Amdari

# Skills- Data Analysis, PowerBi, PostgresSQL

# Project Description- 
FreshHarvest Foods Ltd., founded in 2004, is a U.S.-based food processing company specializing in organic frozen meals, soups, and vegetable mixes. It has become a nationally recognized brand known for sustainable sourcing, clean-label products, and innovative packaging. Serving health-conscious consumers and major retailers like Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s, its competitive edge lies in clean processing, farm-direct sourcing, and strong cold-chain logistics.

# Project Aim- 
The aim of the project is to identify and analyze the root causes of defective batches in food processing to improve product quality, reduce waste, and enhance operational efficiency. By leveraging data from production, quality control, and supply chain operations, the project seeks to uncover patterns and weaknesses contributing to defects. Ultimately, it supports proactive decision-making, strengthens traceability, and ensures compliance with food safety standards.

# Project Rationale- 
Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in food processing focuses on uncovering the underlying causes of batch failures and quality issues to improve transparency and proactive quality management. The initiative aims to reduce financial losses, protect brand reputation, and ensure regulatory compliance through better traceability. It also enhances production efficiency and supports informed decision-making with data-driven insights and dashboards.

# Project Overview-
FreshHarvest continues to face recurring defective product batches despite stringent quality controls. Key challenges include poor batch-level traceability, inconsistent machine calibration, and delayed detection of defects—often only identified after full production. Additionally, reliance on manual QC logs and the inability to spot patterns across time, teams, or suppliers further complicate root cause analysis and corrective actions.

# Conclusion- 
In conclusion, the analysis of defective batches at FreshHarvest Foods has uncovered critical gaps in traceability, process monitoring, and data consistency that have directly impacted product quality, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction. By systematically integrating data from across production, quality control, and supply chain operations, the root causes—ranging from inconsistent machine calibration to fragmented QC documentation—have been identified with clarity. This data-driven approach not only equips FreshHarvest with actionable insights to reduce waste, recalls, and rework, but also lays the foundation for a culture of continuous improvement. Moving forward, implementing automated tracking, predictive defect models, and real-time dashboards will empower the company to transition from reactive quality control to proactive quality assurance—ultimately strengthening its brand reputation, regulatory compliance, and competitive edge in the organic food market.
